## About SynSemClass

**SynSemClass** is an event-type ontology in multiple languages. The project attempts to create specifications and definitions of a hierarchical event-type ontology, populated with words denoting events or states (primarily verbs, verbal nouns, and adjectives, but also any other single- or multiword units denoting events or states). It links its entries or "classes" (and the words that evoke them) to several existing lexical resources that exist and has, to some extent, similar goals; such linking allows for both theoretical and practical comparison and use of the resources.
